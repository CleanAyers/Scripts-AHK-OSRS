# RuneScape Automation Scripts (AutoHotkey)

This repository contains **AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts** designed for automating various actions in the video game **RuneScape**. These scripts were developed and used between **2021 and 2023**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
- These scripts were used to successfully **evade anti-cheating metrics** by implementing **random sleep intervals** and **randomized click boxes**.
  - Including totally maxxing the character to 2277 Total level
- The **click boxes are hardcoded**, meaning users must **manually adjust them** to fit their own game setup.  
- These scripts are **outdated** and may no longer work with current RuneScape updates or anti-cheat measures.  

## 🔧 Features  
✔️ Randomized sleep intervals to mimic human behavior  
✔️ Dynamic click boxes for less detectable automation  
✔️ Simple AHK syntax for easy customization  

## ❗ Warning  
Using automation scripts in RuneScape **violates the game’s rules** and may result in bans. Use at your own risk.

### 📌 Versioning
